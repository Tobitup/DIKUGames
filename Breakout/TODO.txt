############ Rapport TING ##################################
- You could add a bit of your understanding of the problem to the part about blocks
- You should elaborate to really convince the reader that a mediator pattern is used here.
- To avoid triggering your TA's (and possibly the external examiners OCD) I recomend that you keep the arrows straight in the UML diagram!
- Having a black background confuses the reader. Is aggregation or composition used for the diamonds here? There is a functionality in UMLet to export the diagram. 
- Perhaps you can include some SOLID to justify why this is a good design for level loading.
- Clearly there are more interesting things you should elaborate on in design and implementation???????????????
- Also state how you have fulfilled/Will fulfill R.4 - It would be easy to implement new blocks.

############ KODE TING ######################################
- You have to handle invalid .txt files, if i remove a bit of level1.txt it will throw a nasty exception. 
- Fix 4.2.2, folder called EntityTests
- Remove compiler warnings and print statements you have used in your own debugging
- Remove empty and commented out files and comments

- implement ball

- Change level by keypress (Statemachine)

- Clean up code !!! :)

############ TEST TING #####################################
- 4 player tests fails due to FileNotFoundException, please fix this. See my tip on referencing 

- Just testing on the type resulting from reading data does not really convince the reader that your LevelLoading works correctly. 
Try loading in a small sample input.txt and see if it is stored data structures exactly as expected. 

- As we have discussed in class before be careful when asserting not something. 
Asserting that the player is not in the middle does not prove that the player has moved left. It could have moved right or up or whatever.

- Create test for levelloading

- Create StateTestFolder and test state implementation
- Create EntityTest folder
    - Test ball and collitionsdetection
    - Test block

- Create PointTest folder
    - Test PlayerReward

For resubmission of the code, please: ################################################
  * Fix things mentioned under 'Tests', Especially refactor and create missing tests.
  * Fix R.3 - Empty or invalid files do not crash the program
